"""
A composition system for creating backend objects.

Backends implement install(), start() and stop() methods. A backend is composed
of many mixins and each mixin will implement any/all of those methods and all
will be called. Backends additionally provide for collecting property values
from each mixin into a single final property on the backend.

Mixins are not actually mixed in to the backend class using Python inheritance
machinery. Instead, each mixin is instantiated and collected in the Backend
__init__, as needed. Then the install(), start(), and stop() methods have a
"self" that is the simple instantiated mixin, and a "backend" argument that is
the backend instance. Python inheritance machinery is somewhat mimicked in that
certain properties and methods are explicitly aggregated on the backend
instance: see the call_methods function.

There is also a feature for determining if configuration values have changed
between old and new configurations so we can selectively take action.

The mixins appear in the code in the order they are instantiated by the
backend. Keeping them that way is useful.
